                 for Genetic Programming (GP) using a schema definition
                 that accounts for the variable length and the
                 non-homologous nature of GP's representation. In a
                 manner similar to early GA research, we use
                 interpretations of our GP Schema Theorem to obtain a GP
                 Building Block definition and to state a ``classical''
                 Building Block Hypothesis (BBH): that GP searches by
                 hierarchically combining building blocks. We report
                 that this approach is not convincing for several
                 reasons: it is difficult to find support for the
                 promotion and combination of building blocks solely by
                 rigourous interpretation of a GP Schema Theorem; even
                 if there were such support for a BBH, it is empirically
                 questionable whether building blocks always exist
                 because partial solutions of consistently above average
                 fitness and resilience to disruption are not assured;
                 also, a BBH constitutes a narrow and imprecise account
                 of GP search behaviour.

  notes =        "FOGA-3 An early version of this paper is an SFI
                 Technical Report (see \cite{OReilly:1992:tabbGP}). The
                 paper was accepted to a conference called ``Foundations
                 of Genetic Algorithms III''. It was presented at the
                 conference in Estes Park, Co, in July of 1993 (1994?)
                 and the latest version will appear in proceedings
                 forthcoming this year.

                 Presents a schema theorem for genetic programming based
                 on analogy with Holland's ST. Definition of schema more
                 general than Koza's (in Koza:book). Also delvelops
                 building block hyposthesis (again using analogy with
                 linear GA's). Then comprehensively trashes them both!
                 Some arguments against them apply equally well to
                 linear (bit string) GAs.

                 Chapter 4 of U.M. O'Reilly's PhD thesis
                 \cite{OReilly:thesis} is similar to this paper. Pages
                 192-196 of Chapter 7 summarize the results.",
